# Random-Number

The Linear Congruential Random Number Generator is a popular method of creating random numbers. It is linear congruential as the values are related to each other in a linear way, modulo m. It uses the sequence generator of:

Xi =(a×Xi−1+c)mod m and where X is the initial seed value of the series. 

This Program can generate upto 1,00,000 random numbers with no repetations.
